        <h3>Listening to music</h3>
        <div>Who doesn't love to just sit down and listen to some good music? There are many amazing artists out there, but I got to
        admit that my absolute favourite is the one and only Taylor Swift. I just adore her songs and I think that she is one
        brilliant songwriter. In the table below I gave a list of my top 5 songs that I will never stop listening to.</div>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Name of the song</th>
                <th>Reason why it is one of my favourite songs</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>All Too Well (10 Minute Version)</td>
                <td>This ten minute masterpiece changed my whole perspective of how I view the music industry. Every second is a new breathtaking experience.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>The Archer</td>
                <td>This song is a perfect representation of the deep emotions that one person can feel. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>This is me trying</td>
                <td>Just like the previous one, this song shows true feelings of trying to be your best self. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Marjorie</td>
                <td>With exquisite lyrics, this song really shows how it is to lose a loved one. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fifteen</td>
                <td>A simple, yet amazing song which represents a new, thrilling start. </td>

            I chose this particular interest because I like to just relax and watch a nice movie or a series. My favourite
            genres are science-fiction and fantasy. I love many series, but Dark is my number one. Also, Harry Potter is a
            franchise that brings out the inner-child in me.

        <h3>Reading books</h3>
        <div>
            Reading books is a great hobby that I picked up during the pandemic in 2020. There are many excellent authors
            who have skills to paint the clearest picture with few simple words. I love reading different genres from classics
            like <i>Les Mis√©rables</i> by Victor Hugo to modern fascinating thrillers like <i>Carrie</i> by Stephen King.
